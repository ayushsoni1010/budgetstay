## What is BudgetStay?
BudgetStay is a budget-friendly accommodation specially designed for students to provide clean and hygienic homes away from home. After all, we all love our home as much as we love our food. Homes are as lovable as food. Both provide comfort, warmth, and never disappoint.  

MEME 

## Problem Statement 
Nowadays, finding a space to live has become so much easier. But you donâ€™t get the guaranty of being secure and safe. 

You get what you want, but the reality is very different! Let's say you are looking for hostels that provide vegetarian food (especially Jain food). You visit and find it to be an ideal place for you to stay. Once you start living, you realize that everything was just "dikhane ke daat"! Here is a real-time problem faced by one of the students.
